      Building my own wearable from scratch: low-power hardware, embedded UX, and a custom firmware stack.

  <!-- OVERVIEW -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2 class="section-title">Overview</h2>
    <p class="project-text">     
      I’ve always liked the idea of <em>building</em> my own wearable instead of just buying one, so I’m designing a 
      custom smartwatch from the ground up. The goal isn’t to beat Apple or Samsung, it’s to understand what it really 
      takes to ship a tiny, always-on device that someone actually wears every day.
      <br><br>
      On the technical side, I’m building a full stack: a low-power embedded platform with a small display, touch input, 
      persistent storage, and wireless connectivity, plus firmware that makes it feel like an actual product instead of a demo. 
      The watch handles “glanceable” interactions like time/date, quick status, and on-the-fly notes built around the idea that 
      at a convention or networking event, the watch should function like a compact cheat sheet you can access instantly.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- WHAT I'M BUILDING -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2 class="section-title">What I’m Building</h2>
    <p class="project-text">
      Under the hood, the watch is a layered embedded system:
    </p>
    <ul class="project-list project-text">
      <li><strong>ESP32-S3 platform</strong> driving a small color display with a custom UI built in <strong>LVGL</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Touch interaction + gesture navigation</strong> (page switching, mode toggles, note cycling)</li>
      <li><strong>BLE communication layer</strong> for sending commands, notes, and status updates from a companion app</li>
      <li><strong>Persistent storage</strong> using NVS/Preferences so notes survive reboots</li>
      <li><strong>RTC-backed timekeeping</strong> so the clock stays accurate even when powered off</li>
       <li><strong>PLA chassis</strong> custom designed frame for the watch</li>
      <li>A companion <strong>web app</strong> that connects over BLE, manages notes cleanly, and syncs time/date</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="project-text">
      Right now, the watch is already at the point where it feels usable: you can swipe between pages, store multiple company
      notes, search and jump to a specific company, and keep accurate time across power cycles.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- TECHNICAL FOCUS -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2 class="section-title">Technical Focus</h2>
    <p class="project-text">
      This project is my sandbox for combining embedded systems, UX, and product thinking. Some of the areas I’m
      deliberately pushing on:
    </p>
    <ul class="project-list project-text">
      <li><strong>Embedded UI performance + responsiveness:</strong> keeping interactions smooth while layering multiple screens and animations</li>
      <li><strong>Firmware architecture:</strong> building the watch like a real product (state, persistence, commands, UI updates) instead of a monolithic loop</li>
      <li><strong>BLE protocol design:</strong> designing a simple command system that works in nRF Connect <em>and</em> scales to real apps</li>
      <li><strong>Persistence + reliability:</strong> saving notes/time safely, handling edge cases, and making sure the device recovers cleanly after resets</li>
      <li><strong>RTC integration:</strong> migrating from a purely software-ticked clock to a real RTC and debugging library/API mismatches</li>
      <li><strong>Human usability constraints:</strong> making sure the UI works for real use (long notes, scrolling behavior, quick access to the right info)</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2 class="section-title">Challenges &amp; What I Learned</h2>
      <p class="project-text">
        A big part of this project has been dealing with real engineering friction
    </p>
    <ul class="project-list project-text">
      <li>
      <strong>RTC integration wasn’t plug-and-play:</strong> library API mismatches, compile errors, and syncing logic issues forced a deeper understanding
      of I2C bring-up and time synchronization across power cycles.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Gesture UX tradeoffs:</strong> balancing scrolling within a long note while preserving swipe gestures for switching companies was a subtle
      but very real interaction design problem on a tiny screen.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Companion app evolution:</strong> moving from nRF Connect to a structured UI required treating BLE commands like a real product API,
      not just a debug interface.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>AI note generation pipeline:</strong> early outputs were too vague to be useful, which pushed improvements in prompt design and output constraints
      to prioritize concrete conversation starters over generic company summaries.
    </li>
       <li>
      <strong>Frame design:</strong> While I have had plenty of experience working with SOLIDWORKS and mechnical design, doing something at a small scale was a new challenge as 
         it made me think about deformities, warping, and if it could print that you don't need to consider when working with metals like my other projects.
    </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- WHY IT MATTERS -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2 class="section-title">Why I’m Building It</h2>
    <p class="project-text">
      This project is forcing me to think like a product engineer instead of just a lab student. It’s not enough for the
      code to “work”  the watch has to feel good to use, last long enough on a charge, and make smart tradeoffs between
      features and constraints.
      <br><br>
      I'm still making small changes but overall I'm really proud of this as it was my first physical end to end "product-like" project
