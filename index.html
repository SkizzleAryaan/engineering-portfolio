  <h1>🛠 Aryaan's Engineering Portfolio</h1>
  <p>Welcome! Here are some of the engineering projects I've worked on:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>TM4C Game Console</strong> – Built a full game system with real-time audio, input, and interrupt-based firmware.</li>
    <li><strong>Pet Travel Safety System</strong> – Designed a smart cabin monitor for traveling pets using temperature sensing and fail-safes.</li>
    <li><strong>ESP32-to-TM4C Bridge</strong> – Created a Wi-Fi-enabled embedded bridge for UART data passthrough and logging.</li>
    <li><strong>Thrust Vectoring Rocket Firmware</strong> – Wrote Arduino-based control firmware for a custom gimbal actuator system.</li>
    <li><strong>eClair Robotics Companion</strong> – Built a real-world talking robotic sidekick powered by an OLED face and servo arms.</li>
    <li><strong>ADync Custom ADC Toolkit</strong> – Created a tool to experiment with high-speed analog-to-digital sampling in C.</li>
  </ul>
